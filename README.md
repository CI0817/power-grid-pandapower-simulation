# power-grid-pandapower-simulation
## Expected Learning Outcomes
The expected learning outcomes:
- Become familiar with `pandapower`
- Learn the basics of power grid
- Learn the fundamentals of power system analysis using `pandapower`

## Project Aims
This project aims to:
- Simulate the power usage of a small town in Victoria
- Simulate short-circuit fault at various points in the network and analyse their effects
- Incorporate renewable energy into the town and re-analyse the power consumption

## Project Stages
This project can be separated into three stages:
- Learn the basics of `pandapower` through test networks and reading the [documentation](https://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
- Create an imaginary town in Victoria and simulate its power usage and fault analysis.
    - The town should be similar to a real town as it should be close to real life as possible.
- Add renewable energy power into the energy mix and re-analysis the power usage.
